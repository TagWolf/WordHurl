### How to Play

TL;DR: Click to select a Word Tile and then click or type the letter of a Guess Tile with the letter you think goes there before you run out of misses!

WordHurl is an addictive daily word game that is a little bit of Hangman and Scrabble, with a dash of BattleShip sprinkled on top. Your goal is to figure out what today's word is that is hidden in the Word Tiles by guessing which Guess Tile goes into a particular Word Tile slot before your Misses Remaining are completely gone.

There are three main rows of tiles. The Word Tiles hide the word you are trying to figure out one guess at a time, the Guess Tiles contains all the letters of the hidden word above but they are scrambled, and History Tiles keep a record of your guesses and whether they are hits or misses.

Start by guessing a letter position in the Word Tile row by selecting one of the Word Tiles. Think carefully and then click the Guess Tile you think goes in that slot. The game will let you know if you got a hit or a miss and keep a record of guesses for each Word Tile. A hit (match) will not count against your remaining turns, but a miss will.

When you correctly guess the position of one of your scrambled Guess Tiles, the Word Tile where the Guess Tile correctly goes will reveal itself and that Guess Tile will becoming inactive so you don't have to worry about guessing a tile you already figured out.

Pick another Word Tile and misses from the last tile will unmark themselves so you can try those unsolved Guess Tiles in other positions. Continue the process of picking a Word Tile and guessing with a Guess Tile until you have either uncovered the entire word or used up all of your misses.

Try to impress your friends by using the least number of guesses possible to solve the puzzle for today and share your score on social media!

Tips #1: Games reset to a new word at midnight.

Tips #2: A correct guess (hit) will case the selection box to automatically move to the next unsolved tile on the right.

Tips #3: You can either click a Guess Tile or type the matching letter on your keyboard.
